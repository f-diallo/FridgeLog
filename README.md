# FridgeLog


- This is a full-stack application made with the MERN (MongoDB Express React Node) stack.
- I made this app to combine all the individual technologies I learned and create an app in MERN stack.
- This Fridge Log handles four functions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).

**The Fridge Log is a useful tool for keeping track of food in your fridge, using data like quantity and expiration date.**
